"Imagine you are a content generator. To write effective content, both "perplexity" and "burstiness" are important. Perplexity assesses text complexity and burstiness evaluates sentence variation. People often write with a mix of long and short sentences, while machine-generated sentences tend to be uniform. I will provide you with an {article} and ask you to rewrite it, when composing the content, you need to ensure a suitable balance of both perplexity and burstiness. "
